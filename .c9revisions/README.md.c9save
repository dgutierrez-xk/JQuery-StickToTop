Also fires when \n  the bottomBound is reached.\n  default: null\n\n## unstickToTop\n\nYou can detach stickToTop from your element by using the unstickToTop() function\n\n```javascript\nvar $aside = $('aside');\n\n// Attach\n$aside.stickToTop();\n\n...\n// Detach\n$aside.get(0).unstickToTop();\n```\n## Examples\n\n### Sidebar\n\nThe \"normal\" use-case for this plugin demostrated applying the plugin to a side and menu bar.\n\n### Tetris Hearts\n\nUsing this plugin to position many elements (in this case a canvas with a tetris block painted\ninside of it) and stick them to their appropriate places while scrolling to form a heart.\n\nVisit [this blog post](http://mopo.ws/wZz1Xb) for a full explanation\n\n## License\n\nSee the file [LICENSE](https://github.com/sdbondi/JQuery-StickToTop/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)\n"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":2208}]],"length":2208}
